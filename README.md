# Portfolio [01]

Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Jericho Fillon, and I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building beautiful, user-friendly web applications. This website serves as a showcase of my latest projects and a testament to my skills as a developer.


## Technologies Used

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that allows for easy server-side rendering and seamless deployment. For content management, I've integrated [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/), a headless CMS that provides a flexible and easy-to-use content editing experience. I've also used [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for prototyping.


## Job Preferences

I'm currently seeking opportunities as a front-end developer, with a particular interest in working with Next.js and other modern front-end frameworks. I'm passionate about building user-friendly and performant web applications and collaborating with a team to create great products.
